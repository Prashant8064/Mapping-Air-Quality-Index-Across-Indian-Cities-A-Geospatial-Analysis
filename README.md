# Mapping Air Quality Index Across Indian Cities: A Geospatial Analysis

This project presents a geospatial data science analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI) values across major Indian cities. Using Python, public datasets, and mapping libraries, we visualize and classify the air quality to draw meaningful insights and highlight pollution patterns.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Visualize AQI data on an interactive map of India.
- Categorize cities by AQI levels using the CPCB standards.
- Identify regions with the highest and lowest air quality.
- Provide filtering features on the map for better exploration.

## 📊 AQI Classification (CPCB Standard)

| AQI Range | Category        | Color Code  |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| 0–50      | Good             | Green       |
| 51–100    | Satisfactory     | Light Green |
| 101–200   | Moderate         | Yellow      |
| 201–300   | Poor             | Orange      |
| 301–400   | Very Poor        | Red         |
| 401–500   | Severe           | Dark Red    |
